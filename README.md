Worked on Predicting Breast Cancer outcomes using machine learning techniques. This project includes:

Dataset Preparation: Cleaning and preprocessing the data for analysis.
Feature Engineering: Selecting and transforming key features to enhance model performance.
Model Development: Building classification models to distinguish between benign and malignant cases.
Performance Evaluation: Assessing model accuracy and optimizing for better results.

This project is aimed at leveraging data science to assist in early detection and diagnosis of breast cancer. Feel free to explore the repository and share your thoughts!
